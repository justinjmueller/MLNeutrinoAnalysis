# MLNeutrinoAnalysis
This is a C++ project that implements a neutrino selection (primarily 1mu1p) using the outputs from an end-to-end machine learning reconstruction chain. The main outputs of the reconstruction are interaction- and particle-level clustering and classification. This is supplemented by truth information, CRT hits, and matches between interactions and PMT flashes from OpT0Finder. The common output of this reconstruction chain is a set of CSV files.

The CSV files produced by the reconstruction chain are consumed by this code and organized in a hierarchical event format. Each event has a list of interactions (truth and predicted), their respective particles, CRT hits, PMT flashes, and various matching that associate one instance to another (e.g. matching between truth and predicted, TPC-PMT matching with OpT0Finder). The events are then written to a ROOT TTree for easy viewing of variables and storage. The primary function of this code is to implement a selection using the information from the reconstruction.
